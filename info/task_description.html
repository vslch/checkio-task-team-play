<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Two teams of robots are playing the game of <i>cut-or-bend</i>. 
	The rules of the game are very simple:
	<ul>
		<li>
		The team that has processed more details than its opponent is
		a winner.
		</li>
		<li>
		A detail is considered to be processed if it is either bent or cut.
		</li>
		<li>
		Each robot can perform both bending and cutting, but during the game  
		it can perform only one of two functions.
		</li>
		<li>
		Each team consists of N players, K of them must be occupied with cutting. 
		All the rest must be occupied with bending. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	Suppose you are the coach of one of these teams. You are given two lists 
	of positive integers both of size N representing stats of your team. The i-th value 
	in the first list is the number of details that can be cut by the i-th member of 
	the team during the game. Similarly, the i-th value in the second list is the number 
	of details which can be bent by the i-th member of the team during the game. Knowing 
	the value of K, calculate the maximum score which can be obtained by your team.

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> 
	Three arguments. Two lists of integers of equal size representing team's stats. 
	An integer - a number of team's members that have to be occupied with cutting.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> 
	An integer - the maximum score which can be obtained by the team.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>

Consider having input to be <i>[4, 2, 1], [2, 5, 3], 2</i>. The best score is obtained 
by assigning the first and the third robots to perform cutting and the second robot 
to perform bending.

<pre class="for_info_only">
cut : [4, _, 1] -> total:  5
bend: [_, 5, _] -> total:  5
------------------------------
                   total: 10
</pre>

<pre class="brush: python">
max_score([4, 2, 1], [2, 5, 3], 2) == 10
max_score([7, 1, 4, 4], [5, 3, 4, 3], 2) == 18
max_score([5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], 1) == 15
</pre>

    <i>
	This is a discrete optimization puzzle. As Leonhard Euler has stated,
	"Nothing in the world takes place without optimization, and there is no 
	doubt that all aspects of the world that have a rational basis can be 
	explained by optimization methods."
